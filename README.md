### Hi! My name is Hannes. 👋

I'm a engineer and coach for TypeScript, React and Testing.  
I like to share my lernings and workflows though [:octocat: open source projects](https://github.com/Xiphe?tab=repositories)
and [📖 blog posts](https://xiphe.net/blog).

In another universe i'm a procrastinating [👩‍🎤 singer, songwriter and producer](https://hannesdiem.de) traveling in his [🚌 oldtimer campervan](https://www.instagram.com/p/B5kNNy5I_Hw/) spending most of his time [🏄‍♀️ kite surfing](https://www.instagram.com/p/Btjp_-1D9wX/), drinking spanish beer and smoking shisha. 

My lifegoal is to [💰 make a living](http://gph.is/1L5kQ7j) with open source, coaching and music.  
Until then I'm available to [👨‍💻 drastically improve your web tooling, applications and teams](mailto:hi@xiphe.net?subject=Let's%20talk&body=Hi%2C%20I%20found%20you%20on%20GitHub%20and%20would%20like%20to%20discuss%20some%20ideas.%20Please%20call%20me%20asap.).
