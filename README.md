### Hi! I'm Hannes. 👋

I'm a engineer and coach for TypeScript, React and Testing.  
I share my lernings and workflows though [:octocat: open source projects](https://github.com/Xiphe?tab=repositories)
and [📖 blog posts](https://xiphe.net/blog/testing/component-design-testing.html?ref=github_profile).

In another universe i'm a live streaming [👩‍🎤 singer, songwriter and producer](https://hannesdiem.de/linktree/?ref=github_profile) traveling in my [🚌 oldtimer campervan](https://www.instagram.com/p/B5kNNy5I_Hw/) spending most of my time [🏄‍♀️ kite surfing](https://www.instagram.com/p/Btjp_-1D9wX/).
